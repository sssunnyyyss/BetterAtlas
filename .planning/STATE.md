# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Students can coordinate course planning with friends while quickly discovering fitting classes with AI guidance.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 planning/execution prep (recommendation cards and quality hardening)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 4 (v1.1 started at phase 2)
Plan: 04-01 (next)
Status: Phase 03 complete and human-approved; ready to start phase 04
Last activity: 2026-02-27 - Approved phase 03 verification and closed out phase execution

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.62 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1 prioritized toggle correctness over broad UI redesign.
- [Phase 01-program-and-major-toggle-accuracy]: Use trimmed/lowercased strict name matching first, with normalized fallback only when strict candidates cannot provide both kinds.
- [Phase 01-program-and-major-toggle-accuracy]: Rank variant candidates by exact degree affinity before lexical/id tie-breakers.
- [Phase 01-program-and-major-toggle-accuracy]: Filter listPrograms to active rows and deterministic ordering for stable catalog selection.
- [Phase 01-program-and-major-toggle-accuracy]: Frontend selector logic is centralized in programVariantSelection utilities for options, toggles, and tab canonicalization.
- [Phase 01-program-and-major-toggle-accuracy]: Program-mode major/minor switching now prefers previous same-kind selections before degree-aware deterministic fallback.
- [Phase 01-program-and-major-toggle-accuracy]: AI summary/highlights contribute bounded deterministic ranking boosts with stable fallback ordering.
- [Milestone v1.1 kickoff]: Scope is a complete AI chat UI polish/redesign with API compatibility preserved.
- [Milestone v1.1 roadmap]: Sequence work as foundation → interaction smoothness → cards + quality hardening.
- [Plan 02-01 chat foundation]: Centralize AI chat send/reset/deep-link orchestration in `useChatSession` while keeping request payload semantics unchanged.
- [Plan 02-01 chat foundation]: Route and embedded AI chat must render via the same `ChatShell` header/feed/composer contract.
- [Plan 02-02 visual hierarchy]: Use tokenized role/status styling so user/assistant and lifecycle visuals remain consistent across components.
- [Plan 02-02 visual hierarchy]: Neutralize global textarea min-height/resize only within chat composer via a local CSS class override.
- [Plan 02-03 responsive hardening]: Use explicit `ChatShell` standalone/embedded variants with bounded feed/composer zones to avoid clipping and overlap.
- [Phase 02 verification]: Lock core chat foundation behavior with automated `AiChat.foundation` tests plus a repeatable breakpoint QA checklist.
- [Plan 03-01 mobile composer ergonomics]: Apply `useComposerViewport` keyboard insets at the ChatShell composer zone to keep input controls reachable without changing shell decomposition.
- [Plan 03-01 mobile composer ergonomics]: Model keyboard-open behavior in tests with deterministic VisualViewport mocks instead of user-agent heuristics.
- [Plan 03-02 transitions]: Track request lifecycle metadata (sequence/reason/timing) in session state for deterministic state progression.
- [Plan 03-02 transitions]: Gate turn/status animations and scroll behavior by reduced-motion preference and user intent to avoid jitter.
- [Plan 03-03 recovery/onboarding]: Retry replays retained failed payload and preserves conversation context instead of adding duplicate prompt turns.
- [Plan 03-03 recovery/onboarding]: Starter chips use deterministic structured intents and display only for zero-turn states.

### Pending Todos

- Plan and execute phase 04 recommendation card redesign and quality hardening.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Preserve current AI recommendation behavior while redesigning the UI.
- Keep motion subtle and accessible to avoid performance regressions.
